                <p>As a pediatric neuropsychologist, she has built a multidisciplinary and innovative research program including clinicians and researchers with applied or methodological backgrounds. Using cutting-edge multimodal neuroimaging, a significant part of her research program is dedicated to language and brain development in clinical populations. Her research in epilepsy (SickKids/CIHR, FRQS, Savoy Foundation funded) has pioneered the development of presurgical imaging techniques using NIRS-EEG (Montreal) and MEG-EEG (Boston). She led the implementation of these methods in clinical environments (CHU Sainte-Justine, CHUM, Massachusetts General Hospital) where they are now routinely used with patients with severe epilepsy, reducing the need for or extent of invasive investigations, thus significantly decreasing the risk of surgical complications. Anne was awarded the 2016 Junior Investigator Award by the Canadian League Against In 2013, she started a large research initiative on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with congenital heart disease (HSFC, RBIQ funded). More specifically, this work aims to better understand the impact of congenital heart disease on neurodevelopment, identify early neuroimaging markers predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes, and provide early intervention in young children at high risk of disabilities. In the same line of research, she identified early EEG markers of language development in preemies, work that propelled a large starting project on the impact of neonatal hypoglycemia on the visual and cognitive development of preemies (CIHR funded).</p>

              Neurodevelopmental disorders prevalence reach 10 to 17% in the general population. Their repercussions are life long and reduce significantly academic achievement, employability and quality of life.

She was amongst the first to advocate for novel strategies in assessing outcomes in clinical trials and other intervention means aiming at improving cognition in children.

                My work culminates to the empirical evidence that learning brain responses and network connectivity can be measured during infancy, and that their alterations predict cognitive impairments severity in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Published in neuroscience and medical journals, my work has revealed the developmental course of sensory brain responses, signal complexity and connectivity, elucidated networks of sensory learning and proved the usefulness of EEG brain responses to study atypical learning and network disturbances. Currently, I lead EEG phenotyping of two international Fragile X Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders clinical trials involving multidisciplinary teams of researchers from the POND, the EU-AIMS and the MIND institute, creating bridges between international teams involved in neurodevelopmental disorders cohorts in order to better understand risks and resilience factors favoring intervention responses. I also innovatively deeply phenotyped hundreds of children with genetic risks (Brain Canada cohorts) to better understand trajectories to target as early as possible children that would benefit from timely interventions. I have more than 73 scientific publications, more than 200 citations per year since 2018 and several articles being cited more than 100 times. My leadership in the study of neurodevelopmental disorders is confirmed by several awarded grants and by the recognition from my peers through their invitations to collaborate on national network initiatives and clinical trials. Thanks to the Brain Plasticity and Plasticity Analysis platform (BAPA) and collaborations with Dre Annette Schenck, my scientific program now includes translational research, benefiting from the human, mice and Drosphophila models research, fostering discoveries on the mechanisms behind neurodevelopmental disorders and on treatments. My contributions include expertise in analyses pipeline developments, cohort testing and data sharing.

                <p>Dr. Owen was previously the Assistant Director of the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at Cambridge University and the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging at Western University.  His research combines structural and functional neuroimaging with neuropsychological studies of brain-injured patients and has been published in many of the world’s leading scientific journals, including Science, Nature, The New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet.  Adrian Owen is best known for showing that functional neuroimaging can reveal conscious awareness in some patients who appear to be entirely vegetative and can even allow some of these individuals to communicate their thoughts and wishes to the outside world. These findings have attracted widespread media attention on TV, radio, in print and online and have been the subject of many TV and radio documentaries. Dr. Owen has played multiple editorial roles, including 8 years as Deputy Editor of The European Journal of Neuroscience.

                <p>Dr. Gotman’s laboratory investigates the mechanisms of generation of epileptic discharges as recorded in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of epileptic patients. His work aims to improve both our understanding of epileptogenesis and our diagnostic techniques. Combining functional imaging techniques (fMRI) and EEG in a novel non-invasive approach, his group studies the brain regions in which abnormal activity is taking place when a discharge occurs. The laboratory also analyzes patterns of High Frequency Oscillations recently discovered in the EEG, which could improve the ability to localize epileptogenic regions and to understand better epileptogenesis. </p>

                <p>Her research focuses on adolescent development, particularly addressing two main questions: (1) Is adolescence a sensitive period for development (e.g., brain development, peer sensitivity, emotional reactivity), resulting in both unique vulnerabilities and opportunities, and (2) What predicts the individual differences found among adolescents with regard to health-risk behaviors and mental health. To address these questions, she conducts longitudinal studies using a variety of tools, including EEG/ERP, impedance cardiography and heart rate variability, actigraphs, and surveys. Her work has been funded by SSHRC, NCE, CFI, OIT, CIHR, and private foundations.</p>
